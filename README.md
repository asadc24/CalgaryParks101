# YYC-PARKS
An app to help find parks in Calgary

Introduction:

YYC-PARKS is a web application aimed to help people find park equipment in the Calgary area. The current iteration of the product features searching based on communities, featuring visualized data and an interactive map for each community. I have built the API endpoints needed for features to be implemented in the future.

Technology Used:

Python: Used for manipulating the City of Calgary datasets into a workable format (Datesets referenced below)
 - Libraries used: shapely, geojson
 
Node/ExpressJS: Used for setting up a REST API to call on our frontend

React: Used for developing the frontend
- Libraries used: <s>Bootstrap CSS</s> Tailwind CSS, Chart JS, Mapbox.JS

Insomnia: General API Endpoint testing
